To test Beullens' attack on PEP, first use

load('pep_find_codewords.sage')

to prepare the lists for the attack.
Then, use

load('test_permutation_recovery.sage')

to use the produced lists for the attack.

Parameters to be considered for each simulation are

- n : code length
- k : code dimension
- q : finite field size
- w _ codewords weight
- L : number of codewords from each code
- max_num_calls : max number of successful ISD calls. There is no guarantee that the considered codes have at least L codewords with weight w, so we use max_num_calls as an exit strategy for the codewords finding procedure;
- test_id_max : max number of generated codes; each is employed as a seed to generate the code, starting from seed 0.
