# The LESS project repository

This repository contains the software artifacts related to the LESS 
signature algorithm.

The *reference_code* folder contains a portable C11 implementation
of the LESS signature algorithm for the three parameter sets specified
in the extended paper reference. The reference implementation provides
a functionality test binary, *less_test*, and a microbenchmark for
x86_64 platforms, *less_benchmark*.

The *attacks* folder contains Sage scripts to simulate codewords
enumerating methods to attack the Code Equivalence Problem; scripts
to estimate the attacks cost are provided as well.
